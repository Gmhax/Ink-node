curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin
sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)

```

### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/inkonchain/node
cd node
```

### Copy .env.example to .env

Make a copy of `.env.example` named `.env`.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

### Open `.env` with your editor of choice

```sh
nano .env
```

### Mandatory configurations (follow the setup below)

- **NETWORK_NAME** - Choose which Optimism network layer you want to operate on:
  - `ink-sepolia` - Ink Sepolia (Testnet)
  - `ink-mainnet` - Ink (Mainnet)
- **NODE_TYPE** - Choose the type of node you want to run:
  - `full` (Full node) - A Full node contains a few recent blocks without historical states.
  - `archive` (Archive node) - An Archive node stores the complete history of the blockchain, including historical states.
- **OP_NODE\_\_RPC_ENDPOINT** - Specify the endpoint for the RPC of Layer 1 (e.g., Ethereum mainnet). For instance, you can use the free plan of Quicknode for the Ethereum mainnet.
- **OP_NODE\_\_L1_BEACON** - Specify the beacon endpoint of Layer 1. You can use [QuickNode for the beacon endpoint](https://www.quicknode.com). For example: https://xxx-xxx-xxx.quiknode.pro/db55a3908ba7e4e5756319ffd71ec270b09a7dce
- **OP_NODE\_\_RPC_TYPE** - Specify the service provider for the RPC endpoint you've chosen in the previous step. The available options are:
  - `alchemy` - Alchemy
  - `quicknode` - Quicknode (ETH only)
  - `erigon` - Erigon
  - `basic` - Other providers

### Optional configurations

- **OP_GETH\_\_SYNCMODE** - Specify sync mode for the execution client
  - Unspecified - Use default snap sync for full node and full sync for archive node
  - `snap` - Snap Sync (Default)
  - `full` - Full Sync (For archive node, not recommended for full node)
- **IMAGE_TAG\_\_[...]** - Use custom docker image for specified components.
- **PORT\_\_[...]** - Use custom port for specified components.

## Operating the Node

### Start

```sh
docker compose up -d --build
```

Will start the node in a detached shell (`-d`), meaning the node will continue to run in the background. We recommended to add `--build` to make sure that latest changes are being applied.

### View logs

```sh
docker compose logs -f --tail 10
```

To view logs of all containers.

```sh
docker compose logs <CONTAINER_NAME> -f --tail 10
```

To view logs for a specific container. Most commonly used `<CONTAINER_NAME>` are:

- op-geth
- op-node
- bedrock-init

### Stop

```sh
docker compose down
```

Will shut down the node without wiping any volumes.
You can safely run this command and then restart the node again.

### Restart

```sh
docker compose restart
```

Will restart the node safely with minimal downtime but without upgrading the node.

### Upgrade

Pull the latest updates from GitHub, and Docker Hub and rebuild the container.

```sh
git pull
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d --build
```

Will upgrade your node with minimal downtime.

### Wipe [DANGER]

```sh
docker compose down -v
```

Will shut down the node and WIPE ALL DATA. Proceed with caution!

## Monitoring

### Estimate remaining sync time

Run progress.sh to estimate remaining sync time and speed.

Uses `Cast` command from Foundry tool set. Installation instructions here: https://getfoundry.sh/.

```sh
./progress.sh
```

This will show the sync speed in blocks per minute and the time until sync is completed.

```
Chain ID: 57073
Please wait
Blocks per minute: ...
Hours until sync is completed: ...
```

### Grafana dashboard

Grafana is exposed at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and comes with one pre-loaded dashboard ("Simple Node Dashboard").
Simple Node Dashboard includes basic node information and will tell you if your node ever falls out of sync with the reference L2 node or if a state root fault is detected.

Use the following login details to access the dashboard:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `ink`

Navigate over to `Dashboards > Manage > Simple Node Dashboard` to see the dashboard, see the following gif if you need help:

## Troubleshooting

### Walking back L1Block with curr=0x0000...:0 next=0x0000...:0

If you experience "walking back L1Block with curr=0x0000...:0 next=0x0000...:0" for a long time after the Ecotone upgrade, consider these fixes:

1. Wait for a few minutes. This issue usually resolves itself after some time.
2. Restart docker compose: `docker compose down` and `docker compose up -d --build`
